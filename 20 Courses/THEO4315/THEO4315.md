# Course Proposal: Theotokos and the Christological Councils

## Course Code
- THEO4315

## Working Title
- Theotokos: Mariology and Christology in Early Ecumenical Councils

## Description (catalog style)
This advanced seminar investigates the theological and historical significance of the title "Theotokos" (God-bearer) for Mary, focusing on its role in shaping Christological doctrine within the early ecumenical councils. Anchored by the question of the distinction between Theotokos and Christotokos, the course explores the debates and controversies at the Councils of Ephesus and Constantinople, and the subsequent impact on Christian doctrine and devotion. Students will engage with primary patristic sources, conciliar documents, and modern scholarship, with particular attention to Eastern Orthodox perspectives and comparative insights from Catholic and Protestant traditions.

The course is structured for learners with limited weekly study time (5–8 hours/week), featuring concise, focused readings (50–100 pages/week), weekly reflection writing, and a culminating synthesis essay. The approach encourages interdisciplinary connections—historical, theological, and cultural—while fostering critical analysis and synthesis in line with the user’s preferred learning style.
