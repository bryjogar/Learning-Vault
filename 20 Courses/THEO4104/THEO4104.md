# Course Proposal: The Reality and Doctrine of Hell in Christian Thought

## Course Code
- THEO4104

## Working Title
- Hell: Existence, Meaning, and Theological Debate

## Description (catalog style)
This course investigates the doctrine of Hell as a central and controversial theme in Christian theology. Students will explore the biblical foundations, patristic interpretations (with a focus on Eastern Orthodox and early Church Fathers), and the evolution of the concept of Hell through the medieval, Reformation, and modern eras. The course will address questions of divine justice, mercy, and the nature of punishment, as well as contemporary debates about universalism, annihilationism, and the compatibility of Hell with an all-loving God. 

The anchor seed, [[Does Hell Exist]], defines the course by centering on the existence, nature, and theological implications of Hell. Optional related seeds such as [[Reflection]] (for personal and pastoral implications of the doctrine) and [[Textual Criticism]] (for examining how textual variants influence doctrinal development) may be integrated to enrich discussion and critical analysis. The course is designed for learners seeking structured, manageable weekly readings, reflective writing, and synthesis, with an emphasis on primary sources and patristic perspectives, in line with the userâ€™s learning preferences and domain expertise.
