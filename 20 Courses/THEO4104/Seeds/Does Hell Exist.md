# #THEO4104: Does Hell Exist
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions and ideas to explore
- Does Hell exist? 
- What is Hell?

## Notes
- The question around an all-loving God "punishing" people for eternity causes this one to come up a lot. 
- I think the concept of "punishment" is actually a more modern description and that's part of why it's complicated to answer

## Course design thoughts
- Possible connected to soteriology and eschatology
- Likely stands on its own within a series of courses.
