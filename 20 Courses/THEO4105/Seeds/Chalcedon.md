# #THEO4105: Chalcedon
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions to explore
- What theological issues were at stake in the Council of Chalcedon, and how did its definition of Christâ€™s two natures influence later debates?

## Notes
- This could be a whole series of courses just studying the contents of the Ecumenical Councils.
