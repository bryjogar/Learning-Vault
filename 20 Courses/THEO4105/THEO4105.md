# Course Proposal: The Council of Chalcedon: Christology and the Two Natures of Christ

## Course Code
- THEO4105

## Working Title
- Chalcedon and the Definition of Christ

## Description (catalog style)
This course offers an in-depth exploration of the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE), focusing on its pivotal role in shaping Christian doctrine regarding the nature of Christ. Students will examine the theological controversies leading up to the council, the debates over Christ’s divinity and humanity, and the resulting Chalcedonian Definition. The course will analyze primary patristic sources, especially from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, and consider the council’s enduring influence on later Christological debates and ecclesial divisions.

The anchor seed, [[Chalcedon]], defines the course by centering on the council’s historical context, theological stakes, and doctrinal outcomes. The structure will feature manageable weekly readings (50–100 pages), regular reflection writing, and synthesis assignments, aligning with the learner’s preference for structured, discussion-driven, and source-based study.
