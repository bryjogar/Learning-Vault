# Course Proposal: Spiritual Disciplines and Christian Formation

## Course Code

## Working Title
- Spiritual Disciplines: Practice, Psychology, and Doctrine

## Description (catalog style)
This course explores the role of spiritual disciplines—such as prayer, meditation, and ascetic practice—in shaping moral and psychological development within the Christian tradition. Anchored in Eastern Orthodox and Patristic sources, students will examine how these practices have historically contributed to spiritual formation, personal transformation, and community life. The course will also consider comparative perspectives from Catholic, Protestant, and secular commentary, fostering interdisciplinary connections between theology, philosophy, and psychology.

The anchor seed, [[Spiritual Disciplines]], defines the course’s focus on the transformative power of spiritual practices. Optional related seeds such as [[Mysticism]] may be integrated to enrich discussion of contemplative traditions. The course is designed for learners seeking structured, reflective engagement with primary sources and practical application, in line with the user’s preference for deep, focused study and synthesis writing.
