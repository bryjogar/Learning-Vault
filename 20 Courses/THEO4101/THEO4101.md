# Course Proposal: Councils, Controversy, and the Theotokos: Ephesus and Constantinople

## Course Code
- THEO4101

## Working Title
- Councils, Controversy, and the Theotokos: Ephesus and Constantinople

## Description (catalog style)
This course explores the pivotal role of the Councils of Ephesus and Constantinople in shaping Christian doctrine, with a special focus on the development of Mariology and the title of Mary as Theotokos. Students will examine the theological debates and controversies that led to and followed these councils, including the Christological disputes surrounding Theotokos versus Christotokos, and the enduring impact on both Eastern and Western Christian traditions. The course will also consider how these councils influenced later doctrinal developments and the ongoing interpretation of Mary’s role in Christian theology.

The anchor seed, [[Ephesus and Constantinople]], defines the course’s core by centering on the historical and theological significance of these two ecumenical councils. Optional related seeds such as [[Theotokos]] and [[Critique of Councils]] may be integrated to provide deeper context on Mariological debates and the evolving authority of ecumenical councils, but the course will remain tightly focused on the events and aftermath of Ephesus and Constantinople. The structure and reading load will be tailored to support in-depth engagement and critical reflection, in line with the user’s learning preferences and expertise.
