# Course Proposal: Greek Nuance and Theological Interpretation in the New Testament

## Course Code
- THEO4301

## Working Title
- Greek Nuance and Theological Interpretation

## Description (catalog style)
This advanced seminar explores how knowledge of Biblical Greek nuances the interpretation of key theological terms and concepts in the New Testament. Anchored in a critical examination of words such as _pistis_, _dikaiosyne_, and _logos_, the course challenges the notion of a monolithic "Koine Greek" and emphasizes the importance of Hebrew linguistic and conceptual underpinnings. Students will engage with primary texts, analyze the interplay between language and theology, and reflect on how subtle shifts in meaning can shape doctrinal understanding. 

Optional related seeds allow for deeper exploration of how Paul's use of Greek interacts with Greco-Roman philosophy, and how textual variants may further complicate theological interpretation. The course is designed for learners with prior exposure to Biblical Greek, and assignments will focus on close reading, critical reflection, and concise analytical writing, in line with advanced learning preferences and a moderate weekly workload.
