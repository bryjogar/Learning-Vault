# Course Proposal: Icons and Iconoclasm in Eastern Christianity

## Course Code
- THEO4201

## Working Title
- Icons, Iconoclasm, and Theological Imagination in Eastern Christianity

## Description (catalog style)
This course offers an advanced, structured exploration of the theology, history, and practice of icons in Eastern Christianity. Anchored by the question of how icons function as theological texts and shape Christian doctrine, the course will examine the development of icon veneration, the controversies of iconoclasm, and the distinctive traditions of iconography (Byzantine, Russian, Coptic). Students will engage with primary sources from the Church Fathers, conciliar documents, and contemporary Orthodox theologians, while also considering comparative perspectives from Catholic and Protestant traditions. The course will address the role of religious imagery in shaping belief and practice, and the enduring significance of icons in liturgy and personal devotion.

The anchor seed, [[Icons]], defines the course’s central inquiry, guiding students through the theological, historical, and artistic dimensions of iconography. Optional related seeds—[[Iconoclasm]], [[Icon Traditions]], [[Icons and Devotion]], and [[Imagery]]—extend the course by providing context on the iconoclastic controversies, regional artistic developments, and the broader role of imagery in Christian spirituality.
