# Course Proposal: Mary in Orthodox Theology: Doctrine, History, and Spiritual Formation

## Course Code
- THEO4312

## Working Title
- Mary in Orthodox Theology: Doctrine, History, and Spiritual Formation

## Description (catalog style)
This course offers an in-depth exploration of the figure of Mary (Theotokos) within Eastern Orthodox theology, focusing on her doctrinal significance, historical development, and role in spiritual formation. Using patristic writings and Orthodox anchor texts, students will examine questions of Mary's sinlessness, her biblical and theological foundations, and her place as "our mother" in the life of the Church. The course encourages critical engagement with primary sources, reflection on comparative perspectives (Catholic, Protestant, and secular), and synthesis of historical and doctrinal themes. Weekly structured readings and reflective writing assignments will foster both deep understanding and practical application, in line with the learnerâ€™s preference for structured, college-like study with interdisciplinary connections.
