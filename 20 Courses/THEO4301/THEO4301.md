# Course Proposal: Knowing God—Apophatic Theology and the Limits of Human Understanding

## Course Code
- THEO4301

## Working Title
- Knowing God: Apophatic Theology and the Limits of Human Understanding

## Description (catalog style)
This course explores the profound question of how humans can know God, focusing on the development and implications of apophatic (negative) theology within the Christian tradition. Anchored by the seed [[Knowledge of God]], students will examine the origins of apophatic thought in Eastern Orthodox and Patristic sources, its philosophical underpinnings, and its enduring influence on Christian doctrine and spiritual formation. The course will also consider how apophatic theology shapes our understanding of God’s transcendence and the boundaries of human language and knowledge.

Weekly assignments will include close readings of primary texts, structured reflections, and synthesis essays, all tailored to your preferred workload and writing expectations.

## Duration
- 8 weeks
