# Course Proposal: The Doctrine of Creation: Theology, Science, and Interpretation

## Course Code
- THEO4102

## Working Title
- Creation: Theology, Cosmology, and Hermeneutics

## Description (catalog style)
This course explores the doctrine of creation as a foundational theme in Christian theology, focusing on how different theological traditions have interpreted the Genesis creation narratives in dialogue with natural philosophy and contemporary cosmology. Students will examine the historical development of creation doctrine, the interplay between scriptural interpretation and scientific discovery, and the ongoing debates about the meaning and significance of creation in the modern world. The course will encourage critical engagement with primary texts, theological commentaries, and scientific perspectives, fostering a nuanced understanding of how faith and reason interact in the context of creation.

The anchor seed, [[Creation]], defines the courseâ€™s core by centering on the theological, philosophical, and scientific dimensions of creation. Optional related seeds such as [[Interpretation]] (exploring hermeneutical approaches to Genesis), [[Archaeology]] (providing historical context for biblical narratives), and [[Climate]] (addressing stewardship and eschatology in light of creation) may be integrated to enrich discussions and provide interdisciplinary perspectives. The course is designed to align with a learner who enjoys deep exploration, values interdisciplinary connections, and prefers a structured, discussion-driven approach with manageable weekly reading and writing expectations.

## Duration
- 8 weeks

## Seed Connections
- **Anchor Seed:** [[Creation]]
