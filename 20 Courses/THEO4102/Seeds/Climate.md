# #THEO4102: Climate
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions to explore
- In what ways can the study of climate ethics reshape theological understandings of stewardship and eschatology?

## Notes
- This is interesting because the very question implies that humans have the ability to make changes locally to affect something that has been around for thousands of years (the climate). I would like to understand more, but this feels like it may fall into a strange category of class type.
