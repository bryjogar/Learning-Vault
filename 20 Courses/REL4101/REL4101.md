# Course Proposal: The Gospel in History and Doctrine

## Course Code
- REL4101

## Working Title
- What is the Gospel? Origins, Development, and Meaning

## Description (catalog style)
This course offers a rigorous, structured exploration of the Christian Gospel—its origins, historical development, and doctrinal significance. Anchored by the question "What is the Gospel?", students will engage deeply with primary sources, especially Eastern Orthodox and Patristic writings, while also considering Catholic, Protestant, and secular perspectives. The course traces how the Gospel has been defined and proclaimed from the apostolic era through the early church and into modern times, examining its theological, ethical, and practical implications.

The anchor seed, [[What is the Gospel]], defines the course’s core inquiry, guiding students through scriptural foundations, historical controversies, and contemporary interpretations. The optional related seed, [[Second Temple Judaism]], extends the course by providing essential historical context for understanding the development of Gospel concepts within early Christianity and its Jewish milieu. The course is designed for advanced learners, with weekly reading assignments (50–100 pages), structured reflection, and synthesis writing, in line with your preferred learning style and time constraints.
