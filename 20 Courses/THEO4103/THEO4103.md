# Course Proposal: Theology and Authority: Jesus, the Scribes, and the Question of Power

## Course Code
- THEO4103

## Working Title
- Christ and Authority: Contrasts and Contexts

## Description (catalog style)
This course explores the nature and sources of authority in the New Testament, focusing on the contrast between Jesus and the religious leaders of his time, particularly the scribes and Pharisees. Through close reading of key biblical passages and engagement with historical and theological scholarship, students will examine how Jesus’ authority is depicted as fundamentally different—rooted in divine power and the ability to command spiritual realities, rather than merely interpret or enforce tradition. The course will also consider the implications of this distinction for Christology and the broader understanding of religious authority in Christian thought.

Building on the anchor seed’s focus on Mark 1:23 and related texts, the course will situate these questions within the wider context of first-century Judaism and early Christian theology.
