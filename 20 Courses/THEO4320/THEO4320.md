# Course Proposal: Spiritual Practice and the Problem of Prelest in Eastern Christianity

## Course Code
- THEO4320

## Working Title
- Spiritual Practice and the Problem of Prelest in Eastern Christianity

## Description (catalog style)
This course offers a focused, advanced exploration of spiritual practice in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, anchored by the concept of prelest (spiritual delusion). Using the seed [[What is prelest]], students will examine the dangers, discernment, and transformative potential of spiritual disciplines such as repentance, confession, and asceticism. The course will draw on Patristic and Slavic Orthodox sources to understand how prelest is diagnosed and addressed, and how authentic spiritual growth is cultivated. 

Optional related seeds—[[Spiritual Practice]] and [[Discernment]]—will be integrated to provide a broader context for the practical and theological dimensions of spiritual vigilance and the cultivation of discernment. The course is structured for advanced learners with limited weekly study time, featuring 50–100 pages of reading per week, weekly reflections, and a culminating synthesis essay, in line with your preferred learning style and workload.
