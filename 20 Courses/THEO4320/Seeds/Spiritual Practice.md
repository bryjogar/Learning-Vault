# Seed: Spiritual Practice
[Status:: #ready]
## Questions to explore
- How do concepts of repentance, confession, and transformation interact in the lives of saints and modern spiritual practice?

## Course creation thoughts
- This is a topic that may be able to stand on its own provided that the course is designed well, otherwise let it be an optional seed for joining with others in relation.
