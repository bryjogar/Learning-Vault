# Seed: Discernment
[Status:: #ready]
## Questions and ideas to explore
- How have Christian mystics historically described the process of spiritual discernment, and how can those practices be applied today?

## Notes
- I listened to a podcast a long time ago about the mysticism of the Eastern church. I was really intrigued

## Course design thoughts
- I think this may fit as a supplemental seed for something about spiritual practice or monastic history.
