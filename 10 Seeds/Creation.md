# #Seed: Creation
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions and ideas to explore
- How have different theological traditions interpreted the doctrine of creation, especially regarding the relationship between Genesis, natural philosophy, and contemporary cosmology?

## Notes
- I took a creation studies class and enjoyed it. There's a lot to explore in this realm

## Course design thoughts
- The sheer volume of opinions on this means it may be that this is an anchor for multiple courses (if so, make sure you clarify that in your response so I don't move the seed).
