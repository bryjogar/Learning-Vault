## Questions and ideas to explore
- How does knowledge of Biblical Greek nuance the interpretation of key theological terms in the New Testament, such as _pistis_, _dikaiosyne_, or _logos_?

## Notes
- I took Biblical Greek classes already, this question really pushes me toward the understanding that "Koine Greek doesn't exist." Understanding the language of the New Testament in particular requires understanding the Hebrew underpinning of most of it.  

## Course design thoughts
