# Seed: Authority
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions to explore
- What is the difference in Jesus' authority and that of the scribes and pharisees? What authority did they have and where does it come from?

## Notes
- Mark 1:23, Jesus authority supersedes the authority of the scribes and pharisees in that they command other people while Jesus commands the spirits themselves

## Course creation thoughts
- This is clearly "Christology" but it is only a subset of the topic. Keep that in mind when determining course creation.
