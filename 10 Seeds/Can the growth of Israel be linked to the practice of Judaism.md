# Seed: Can the growth of Israel be linked to the practice of Judaism
[Status:: #draft]

## Questions and ideas to explore
- Can the growth of modern-day Israel be linked to the practice of Judaism?

## Notes
- I think a lot of American Evangelicals have a distorted view of modern-day Israel.
- Maybe this comes from the contemporary prophecy pundits such as Hagee and other dispensationalist writers?

## Course design thoughts
- I don't know if this seed can stand on its own as an anchor, it may fit better as an additional question within other courses.
- This can be part of a course that fits both religion and history, it can also hit on some anthropology topics.
