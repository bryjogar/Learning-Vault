# Seed: Archaeology
[Status:: #ready]

## Questions to explore
- How do archaeological discoveries illuminate or challenge traditional understandings of key biblical narratives, particularly in the Pentateuch and historical books?

## Notes
- I really enjoyed my archaeology class when I took it in college. Exploring more seems like a fun way to spend some time.
