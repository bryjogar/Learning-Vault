# Seed: Critique of Councils
[Status:: #ready]
## Questions and ideas to explore
- How have later theologians interpreted or critiqued the authority of ecumenical councils in light of heresies, schisms, and doctrinal development?

## Notes
- I certainly am not qualified to "critique" the councils, but reviewing how others have and what that means could be ok.

## Course design thoughts
- This one probably doesn't stand as an anchor, but would be supplemental to others
